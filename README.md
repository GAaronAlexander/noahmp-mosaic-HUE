# Noah-MP version 4.5 master branch archive

This branch is to archive the Noah-MP version 4.3 for application in US National Water Model (NWM), which is consistent with the Noah-MP code released in WRF version 4.3 (branch "release-v4.3-WRF") except that the Gecros crop model part has been removed to be consistent with recent NWM code changes.
